# Aquaponic-System-MCU-Firmware

Just a prototype project I did myself during my Internship which mainly used Arduino IDE and Node-Red, This is My Very first project using Node-Red :)

The aquaponics system Arduino firmware consists of both source code for Arduino Nano board and ESP 8266 board which communicates through serial port
